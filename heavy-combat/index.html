            <p>People come to this site to learn about SCA armored combat, what it’s history is and how they can get involved. What is armored combat you say? SCA armored combat, or heavy combat, is a combat sport were participants dress in protective body armor in the fashion of medieval European armor and fight one another with blunted or rattan weapons. The fighting is full-speed full force combat meant to resemble medieval combat of its time. It is open to all genders, so long as you have the will and skill to perform.</p>
            <p>While relatively new, SCA armored combat has spread around the globe with regional groups being organize into “kingdoms”. They have tournaments were combatants face one another in single combat or take part in large melees with dozens or even hundreds of combatants on each side. The combatants wear real armor and fight with rattan weapons meant to approximate a steel sword but be a lot safer. Novices are taught by more experienced fighters. They are taught how to fight, how to defend, and how to judge blows received. Once a fighter is deemed safe, they are then authorized to fight.</p>
