            <h3>The History</h3>
            <p>The Society for Creative Anachronism is an international non-profit educational organization. They research and recreate pre-17th century skills, arts, combat, culture and hold events, demonstrations, and other educational presentations and activities. It all began at a backyard party of a UC Berkely medieval studies graduate Diana Paxson where the first tournament was held. In 1968 Marion Zimmer Bradley, the one to first coin the name SCA, moved to Staten Island, New York and founded the Kingdom of the East. That September, at a tournament held at the 26th World Science Fiction Convention, which was being held at Berkeley that year, the SCA sold a book called A Handbook for the Current Middle Ages, a how-to book for those wishing to start their own SCA chapters. </p>
            <p>From there it quickly spread. The first proper tournaments were held in 1966 and the SCA has only grown in scope since itâ€™s humble beginnings to encompass most of the world. The biggest event in the SCA is the Pennsic War fought annually between the East Kingdom and Middle Kingdom. It is held in late summer and lasts for 17 days. Unfortunately, due to COVID there has been no Pennsic event held for the past 2 years.</p>
