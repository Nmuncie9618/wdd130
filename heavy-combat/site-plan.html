      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My website is to educate people about and let them know how they can get involved in or attend heavy combat events. Whether it be information on how to find local tournaments, to how to get started or even just learning what the heck this is all about. As a big fan of the sport and a programmer I am in a unique position to teach people about something they might not even know existed. I know when I first discovered the sport it was the coolest thing I’d ever seen.  So, I’d like to spread the word.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My intended audience is anyone who might be interested in heavy combat or anyone who is ignorant of the sport. Those who would like to learn of the history or how to get involved.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        People come to this site to learn about SCA armored combat, what it’s history is and how they can get involved. What is armored combat you say? SCA armored combat, or heavy combat, is a combat sport were participants dress in protective body armor in the fashion of medieval European armor and fight one another with blunted or rattan weapons. The fighting is full-speed full force combat meant to resemble medieval combat of its time. It is open to all genders, so long as you have the will and skill to perform. While relatively new, SCA armored combat has spread around the globe with regional groups being organize into “kingdoms”. They have tournaments were combatants face one another in single combat or take part in large melees with dozens or even hundreds of combatants on each side. The combatants wear real armor and fight with rattan weapons meant to approximate a steel sword but be a lot safer. Novices are taught by more experienced fighters. They are taught how to fight, how to defend, and how to judge blows received. Once a fighter is deemed safe, they are then authorized to fight.

      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        The Society for Creative Anachronism is an international non-profit educational organization. They research and recreate pre-17th century skills, arts, combat, culture and hold events, demonstrations, and other educational presentations and activities. It all began at a backyard party of a UC Berkely medieval studies graduate Diana Paxson where the first tournament was held. In 1968 Marion Zimmer Bradley, the one to first coin the name SCA, moved to Staten Island, New York and founded the Kingdom of the East. That September, at a tournament held at the 26th World Science Fiction Convention, which was being held at Berkeley that year, the SCA sold a book called A Handbook for the Current Middle Ages, a how-to book for those wishing to start their own SCA chapters. From their it quickly spread. The first proper tournaments were held in 1966 and the SCA has only grown in scope since it’s humble beginnings to encompass most of the world. The biggest event in the SCA is the Pennsic War fought annually between the East Kingdom and Middle Kingdom. It is held in late summer and lasts for 17 days. Unfortunately, due to COVID there has been no Pennsic event held for the past 2 years.

      <h3>Get Involved</h3>
      <p>
        There are many ways to get involved, from attending and viewing events to participating in them yourself. To start, find a local group using the SCA’s search tool and from there contact the knight marshal, from there you can talk to them about getting started and attending a practice fight. Visiting their website should help help you know when and where you can go to participate.
