            Hello, my name is Nicholas Muncie but you can just call me Nick. I've been a member of the church for 10 years now. 
            I'm majoring in computer science and above all else I enjoy learning and am excited to work in a field that is constantly 
            changing and in which I'll be required to constantly be learning new things. I'm really looking forward to the spring here 
            in Rexburg.
